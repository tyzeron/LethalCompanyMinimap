# Lethal Company Minimap

Introducing a **Minimap mod** for Lethal Company, a dynamic solution designed 
to enhance your gaming experience. This mod seamlessly integrates a persistent 
minimap on your screen, ensuring that you're never left in the dark, whether 
you're playing solo or in co-op mode.

For solo players, this mod emulates the real-time information flow that would 
typically be provided by a partner stationed at the ship's terminal.

In co-op mode, the Minimap mod ensures that everyone can join in the excitement 
of venturing into the building, eliminating the need for one player to stay 
back at the ship.

# Usage

These are the **default hotkeys**:
- `F1` - open the Minimap Mod menu
- `F2` - toggle the Minimap visibility
- `F3` - override the ship controls
- `F4` - switch the Minimap target (when ship controls are overridden)

**All hotkeys can be easily reconfigured via the Minimap mod menu.**

The Minimap size, position, and the hotkeys, can be customized via the mod menu.

By default, the Minimap is synced with the ship's control panel. However, you 
can override the ship controls. This way, you can ensure that the Minimap focus 
doesn't change even if your teammate switches to a different player in the ship.
It also allows you to switch the focused player on your Minimap without 
affecting the Minimap or ship map of other players.

This is a client-sided mod, meaning that other players don't need to have this 
mod installed.

# Dev Notes

This Minimap mod was a **weekend project**, so the code might be a little messy 
due to the rapid development focus. In line with Donald Knuth's philosophy that 
`early optimization is the root of all evil`, the initial aim was functionality 
rather than optimization.

Your feedback for improving and optimizing the code is warmly welcomed.
